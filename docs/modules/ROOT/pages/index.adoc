## Overview

The devbox provides a virtualbox linux operating system that would typically run on top of a Windows host.
The box is based on https://nixos.org[NixOS] and make sure any setting can be persisted.

The main configuration file is `box.dhall`. It sits in your shared folder.

### Software requirements

- Virtualbox 6.0.x (tested with 6.0.12)

Please do update if you have older version(s).

## First time setup

[TIP]
====
- Have a quick look at the <<_troubleshooting>> section before to get started.
- You can install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for windows] in order to get a terminal console on Windows.
====

### Preparation

Within the host os (usually `Windows`), create a new folder of your choice. You might call it `devbox-x.x` where `x.x` is the major and minor version number of the devbox. This will be your shared folder between the host (Windows) and the guest (the linux box).

====
We will use the term `SHARED_DIR` to refer to this folder throughout the rest of the guide.
====

The `SHARED_DIR` contains personal configuration files.

-----
<1> ssh-keys folder
<2> user configuration
<3> optional system configuration

WARNING: When editing files from the SHARED_DIR, maintain the `unix` file encoding.

You don't need to create any of the user or system configuration files. If a file is not yet present in the SHARED_DIR, it will be created there at the first boot.
You should then edit the template to fill in the requested informationfootnote:[a comment section is present at the top.].

### ssh keys

Without your personal ssh key pairs you won't be able to pull or push to bitbucket repositories.

1. in the `SHARED_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.

### Box import

To import the `ova` image file, just click on the file. The virtualbox UI will pop up.

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]

## Usage

### User provisioning

The most common operation is to modify your user configuration through `box.dhall` in your SHARED_DIR.
To publish these changes, you execute the command `updateUser` in a console.

You might also want to modify your user configuration through the included https://github.com/rycee/home-manager[home-manager].
Such more advanced and optional configuration is done by editing the `local-home.nix` file which also sits in your SHARED_DIR.

### Devbox update

If you wish to bring new features listed in the <<_changelog>>, you will need to update the input of your devbox.
This is done by pulling from the `~/bootstrap` directory of the devbox:

```
→ cd ~/bootstrap
→ git pull
```

To upgrade to the newest devbox release, please read the <<_changelog>> and re-create a brand new box.
See <<_life_cycle>>.

### Advanced system provisioning

The advanced user might want to update the system configuration.
This is useful to setup a postgresql database, an elk cluster, ...
If you want to go into this level of configuration, first import in your SHARED_DIR the example configuration file:
```
curl -o local-configuration.nix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/system/local-configuration.nix
```
To publish your system configuration change, you execute the command `updateSystem` in a console.

### Operating system (nixos)

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS] version 19.03. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager.

Compare to more traditional distributions, NixOS favors declarative settings and brings to the table the following properties:

- *reproducability*: everything is reproducible (packages are identical binary wise).
- *atomicity*: configuration changes can be rollback.
- *isolation*: on a project, user or system level, processes are built in an isolated environment.

By using `nixos` we are striving for a system that we can destroy and re-create at will without fuss.

The entry point for the system setup is the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file.

#### Useful command

```
# rebuild nixos after changing the system configuration file
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high)
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

```

### Windows manager (xmonad)

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

#### Minimal cheat sheet

|======
|Command |Description

| kbd:[Ctrl,Space] |Open app launcher
| kbd:[Super, t] |New terminal
| kbd:[Super, 1..9] |Go to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super, Right] | Go to next desktop
| kbd:[Super, Left] | Go to previous desktop
| kbd:[Super, Shift, 1..9] |Switch to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super,Space] |Change between horizontal, vertical and stack layout
| kbd:[Super,Tab] |In stack layout, switch the stacked window
| kbd:[Super,q] |Close current window
| kbd:[Super,m] , kbd:[Super, h] |Resize windows
| kbd:[Super,w] |Put window back into tiling
| kbd:[F 1] |Open this README in a browser
|======

#### Layout

The active layout is displayed on the status bar:

image::layout-indicator.png[]

[width="35%"]
|=======
|Symbol |Name

| ≡     | horizontal
| ⊤     | horizontal tiled
| ∥     | vertical
| □     | full (stack)
| ⊢     | vertical tiled
|=======

TIP: You can also change layout by clicking on the symbol in the status bar.

### Terminal emulator (termite)

The `devbox` uses the https://github.com/thestinger/termite#keybindings[`termite`] terminal.

|=====
|Command | Description

|kbd:[Control,Shift, c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|kbd:[Control,Shift, {plus}/-/=] |Increase/Decrease/Reset font size
|kbd:[Control,Tab] |Start scrollback completion
|kbd:[Control,Shift,Space] |Start selection mode
|=====

The default user shell is `zsh` which allows for predictable history and completion.

You can use https://github.com/wting/autojump[`autojump`] to quickly navigate from one directory to another using the #j# shortcut:
```
# Go to your directory (you can omit the `cd`)
→ cd projects/cicd/puppet/bos
# Teach autojump that you like bos
→ autojump -i 20
# Open a new terminal. You can now quickly go to ~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos
→ j bos
```

You might also want to enable some `oh-my-zsh` plugins by updating your zshrc. None has been enabled by default to avoid unwanted intrusion. See https://github.com/PierreR/dotfiles/blob/a8e45029767a22998f7a68fdf114297255495d0e/.zshrc#L3[here] for one example.

Another useful shortcut is #sshi# to quickly log to a remote machine. It is the equivalent of `ssh -i ~/.ssh/xxxx_rsa $LOGINID@$1`.

### Application launcher (albert)

https://albertlauncher.github.io/[Albert] is an application launcher similar to `Alfred` in OS X. You can launch albert with kbd:[Control,Space]footnote:[you can change the hotkey in the box.dhall configuration file.]. Use it to:

- open any application, directory or file by typing its name (type 'File' to open `Nautilus`)
- shutdown/reboot the vm
- search the internet with `gg`

### Projects (mr)

The https://myrepos.branchable.com[myrepos] project help you to automate the cloning of multiple git repositories. The usage of `mr` is entirely optional.

Mr files are pointers to repositories you want to clone. These are defined in the same http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse/.config/mr/available.d[CIRB dotfiles repository]. You may propose any new repository definition via a pull request.

To activate an available repository in your devbox, add the name of the file to the `mr.repos` list in 'SHARED_DIR/box.dhall'.

As soon as you type `updateUser` on the command line, the enabled repos will be automatically cloned and configured into your box. For instance if `puppet-bos` is in the list, you will find a `~/projects/bric/box/puppet-bos` folder. In that case, the next step would be to go in that folder and enter `make` on the command line.

To update all registered mr repository, do
```
→ mr -f up <1>
```
<1> you usually don't want to automatically update such repository on provisioning. That's the reason behind the `-f` (force) flag.

You can ask a `git status` of all your repositories with

```
→ mr st
```


## Tips & Tricks

====
The customization of the devbox operates at different levels and ensure configuration - personal or shared - survives the destruction of the box.
====

### Install local packages

To install a package, just do:

```
→ nix-env -i geany <1>
```
<1> install the `geany` package for the vagrant user. The suffix _env_ expresses the fact that only the user environment is affected.

This imperative approach is quite useful for testing but the change is not persistent. When you settle down on a list of packages, please add them to `home.nix` to gain persistence.

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org]

### Open a shell

You can open a shell with the `nix-shell` commmand. For instance to open a shell that have `JAVA_HOME` set:

```
→ nix-shell -p jdk11
```

### Generic dotfiles

The standard https://github.com/CIRB/dotfiles[CIRB dotfiles repositry] maintains a very general default configuration for the devbox. It is continuously evolving and improving. Please feel welcomed to propose any change via a pull request.

TIP: To get a pre-defined default configuration for *Eclipse*, choose `.eclipse/workspace` as your workspace location at first boot.

### Personal mr repositories

You can register any source repository by adding it to https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/4da9cf0a073e98dcdafab5100c156dc537adf57a/config/box-cirb.dhall#L45[mr.config] in `SHARED_DIR/box.dhall`. This is for personal configuration that you don't want to share. After saving the file, you update your box with #updateUser#.

### Storing the box configuration file

You might want to go one step further and store your `box.dhall` file on Github or the like. This is pretty easy thanks to the powerful https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/README.md[dhall configuration language]. Replace the content of `SHARED_DIR/box.dhall` with one simple line containing an url that points to the config file. Here is an example:

.SHARED_DIR/config/box.dhall
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreR/devbox-config/master/box.dhall
```

## Life cycle

The https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues[issues] and the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open[roadmap] are handled directly on Github.

The devbox will be maintained continuously.
Two version are expected to be released every year in April and October following the NixOS release cycle.

The versioning scheme follows the one of NixOS. For instance `19.03.buildnumber`.

When a new major version is released, breaking changes are expected.
It is required to destroy and re-create a box from scratch. An operation that take no longer than 5 minutes.
Please look at the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] to gather information and read the updated README if necessary.
You would commonly need to make some adjustements to your personal configuration file such as `dhall.box` or `local-configuration.nix` before importing them in the new SHARED_DIR.

TIP: Keep the old box and the new one for a while and make sure you aren't losing any customization.

Question, support, discussion are handled in the team `#cicd` channel.

## Without virtualbox

It is possible to use the devbox without the use of Virtualbox for instance within a Nixos linux or a vmware nixos guest.

If you have a nixbox linux up and running, follow these steps:
====
[lowerroman]
. mount your configuration into your nixos box, for instance `/vagrant/shared`footnote:notrequired[not required if you don't want to configure anything]
. add an env variable named `SHARED_DIR` that points to the mounted dirfootnote:notrequired[]
. `git clone https://github.com/CIRB/devbox.git bootstrap`
. cd bootstrap
. `make home-manager`
. (logout/login)
. `make user`
====

If you want to use vmware workstation, we can provide an up-to-dated  vmdk image. You still need to choose a SHARED_DIR to host your configuration files as explain in the <<_preparation, preparation paragraph>>.

## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and register them in stash.cirb.lanfootnote:[We will improve the situation in a future release if it is tagged as a major concern.].

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
That said, keep in mind that various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `hyper-v` and `virtualbox`. It is likely that such compatibilities arise again after a windows or virtualbox update.
+
We will try to offer a hyper-v compatible box using `packer` (no virtualbox) in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
In the meanwhile, if you face such a issue you will have to disable hyper-v to get a working devbox. Please proceed as follow:
+
[lowerroman]
. disable hyper-v
. use virtualbox as hypervisor
. install the docker tools based on a virtualbox machine.

NOTE: The only use of hyper-v we have detected so far is by the latest version of *Docker for Windows*.

For Mac users::
+
There are known critical issues with Virtualbox and VPN clients on `macosx`.

For VMWare users::
+
Please checkout https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1624437[this issue] about OpenSSH.

## FAQ

### Eclipse: how to add plugins ?

Eclipse plugins can easily be added. Please make a request to #devbox or https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues

## How is the box generated ?

The box (of about 2G) is generated in two stages.
The first step generates a minimal generic vagrant box file with packer (currently packer-1.3.5).
The second step applies some customization to produce a more heavy tailored box (desktop, ...).

### Stage 1

. On  a *linux* hostfootnote:[Cloning in Windows will cause many encoding issues!], use the provided `nixbox.sh` script to clone the https://github.com/nix-community/nixbox[nixbox repository] within the shared directory.
. On the host OS, in the nixbox directory, execute the following commands:
+
```
packer.exe build nixos-x86_64.json --only virtualbox-iso
```

### Stage 2

. Create a SHARED_DIR
. Import the `ova` image file using the Virtualbox UI.
. Start the imported vm, login as `vagrant`
.. cd into `/etc/devbox-x.x.x`
.. make system
.. make home-manager
.. logout/login as vagrant
.. make user
. Export the vm
. Push the output to a mirror site.


WARNING: Be careful of keeping the linux encoding when working on files that will end up in the  guest os.
