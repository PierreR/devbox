## Overview

The devbox provides a virtualbox linux operating system that would typically run on top of a Windows host.
The box is based on https://nixos.org[NixOS] and make sure any setting can be persisted.

Customizations are done through changes on your `config/box.dhall` configuration file.

### Software requirements

- Virtualbox 6.0.x (tested with 6.0.12)

Please do update if you have older version(s).

## First time setup

[TIP]
====
- You can generate this help (html and pdf) with `make doc`.
- Have a quick look at the <<_troubleshooting>> section before to get started.
- You can install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for windows] in order to get a terminal console on Windows.
====

### Preparation

. Within the host os (usually `Windows`), create a new folder of your choice. You might call it `devbox-x.x` where `x.x` is the major and minor version number of the devbox.
+
====
We will use the term `ROOT_DIR` to refer to this folder throughout the rest of the guide.
====

. In `ROOT_DIR`, create a new config folder and copy the two files from the https://github.com/PierreR/devbox/tree/master/config[config folder]. Modify them to match your personal settings:
+
```
mkdir config
curl -o config/box.dhall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/config/box-cirb.dhall
curl -o config/shell.dhall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/config/shell.dhall
```
+
WARNING: If you create the file manually, make sure you keep a `unix` file encoding.

### ssh keys

1. in the `ROOT_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.

### Box import

[upperroman]
. Import the `ova` image file using the Virtualbox UI.
. Add your shared directory folder.

## Usage

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]

### User provisioning

The most common operation is to modify your user configuration through the `box.dhall` of your ROOT_DIR.
To publish these changes, you execute the command `updateUser` in a console.

You might also want to modify your user configuration through the included https://github.com/rycee/home-manager[home-manager].
Such more advanced and optional configuration is done by editing the `local-home.nix` file of your ROOT_DIR.
The user configuration involves:

### Devbox update

If you wish to bring new features listed in the <<_changelog>>, you will need to update the input of your devbox.
This is done by (git) pulling from the `~/bootstrap` directory of the devbox.

To upgrade to the newest devbox release, please read the <<_changelog>> and re-create a brand new box.
See <<_life_cycle>>.

### Advanced system provisioning

The advanced user might want to update the system configuration.
This is useful to setup a postgresql database, an elk cluster, ...
If you want to go into this level of configuration, first import in your ROOT_DIR the example configuration file:
```
curl -o local-configuration.nix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/system/local-configuration.nix
```
To publish your system configuration change, you execute the command `updateSystem` in a console.

### Operating system (nixos)

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS] version 19.03. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager.

Compare to more traditional distributions, NixOS favors declarative settings and brings to the table the following properties:

- *reproducability*: everything is reproducible (packages are identical binary wise).
- *atomicity*: configuration changes can be rollback.
- *isolation*: on a project, user or system level, processes are built in an isolated environment.

By using `nixos` we are striving for a system that we can destroy and re-create at will without fuss.

The whole system setup is declared in the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/configuration.nix[/etc/nixos/configuration.nix] file. In the same file you will find the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/configuration.nix#L99-L209[list] of all the system packages installed.

#### Useful command

```
# rebuild nixos after changing the system configuration file
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# install a package in user space
→ nix-env -i atom

# clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high)
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

```

### Windows manager (xmonad)

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

#### Minimal cheat sheet

|======
|Command |Description

| kbd:[Ctrl,Space] |Open app launcher
| kbd:[Super, t] |New terminal
| kbd:[Super, 1..9] |Go to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super, Right] | Go to next desktop
| kbd:[Super, Left] | Go to previous desktop
| kbd:[Super, Shift, 1..9] |Switch to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super,Space] |Change between horizontal, vertical and stack layout
| kbd:[Super,Tab] |In stack layout, switch the stacked window
| kbd:[Super,q] |Close current window
| kbd:[Super,m] , kbd:[Super, h] |Resize windows
| kbd:[Super,w] |Put window back into tiling
| kbd:[F 1] |Open this README in a browser
|======

#### Layout

The active layout is displayed on the status bar:

image::layout-indicator.png[]

[width="35%"]
|=======
|Symbol |Name

| ≡     | horizontal
| ⊤     | horizontal tiled
| ∥     | vertical
| □     | full (stack)
| ⊢     | vertical tiled
|=======

TIP: You can also change layout by clicking on the symbol in the status bar.

### Terminal emulator (termite)

The `devbox` uses the https://github.com/thestinger/termite#keybindings[`termite`] terminal.

|=====
|Command | Description

|kbd:[Control,Shift, c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|kbd:[Control,Shift, {plus}/-/=] |Increase/Decrease/Reset font size
|kbd:[Control,Tab] |Start scrollback completion
|kbd:[Control,Shift,Space] |Start selection mode
|=====

The default user shell is `zsh` which allows for predictable history and completion.

You can use https://github.com/wting/autojump[`autojump`] to quickly navigate from one directory to another using the #j# shortcut:
```
# Go to your directory (you can omit the `cd`)
→ cd projects/cicd/puppet/bos
# Teach autojump that you like bos
→ autojump -i 20
# Open a new terminal. You can now quickly go to ~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos
→ j bos
```

You might also want to enable some `oh-my-zsh` plugins by updating your zshrc. None has been enabled by default to avoid unwanted intrusion. See https://github.com/PierreR/dotfiles/blob/a8e45029767a22998f7a68fdf114297255495d0e/.zshrc#L3[here] for one example.

Another useful shortcut is #sshi# to quickly log to a remote machine. It is the equivalent of `ssh -i ~/.ssh/xxxx_rsa $LOGINID@$1`.

### Application launcher (albert)

https://albertlauncher.github.io/[Albert] is an application launcher similar to `Alfred` in OS X. You can launch albert with kbd:[Control,Space]footnote:[you can change the hotkey in the box.dhall configuration file.]. Use it to:

- open any application, directory or file by typing its name (type 'File' to open `Nautilus`)
- shutdown/reboot the vm
- search the internet with `gg`

### Projects (mr)

The mr files are pointers to repositories you want to clone. These are defined in a separate github repo called http://stash.cirb.lan/scm/devb/vcsh_mr_template.git[vcsh_mr_template].

You can activate any available repositories by setting `repos` in 'ROOT_DIR/config/box'.

The enabled repos will be automatically cloned and configured into your box. For instance if `puppet-bos` is in the list of `repos`, you will find a `~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos` folder. In that case, the next step would be to go in that folder and enter `make` on the command line.

To update all registered mr repository, do
```
→ mr -f up <1>
```
<1> you usually don't want to automatically update such repository on provisioning. That's the reason behind the `-f` (force) flag.

You can ask a `git status` of all your repositories with

```
→ mr st
```

## Tips & Tricks

====
The customization of the devbox operates at different levels and ensure configuration - personal or shared - survives the destruction of the box.
====

### Available mr repositories

The devbox allows to quickly share any configuration across users. This is done by first adding a new `mr` source repository to the list of available repos http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/vcsh_mr_template/browse/.config/mr/available.d[in the mr CIRB template repository].

For instance, let say you want to propose some eclipse (or geany, atom, ...) setup as a base eclipse configuration for the CIRB. First create a git repository with the configuration files, then write a `.mr` file and propose it via  a pull request to the mr CIRB template repository.

As soon as the PR is merged, any devbox user will be able to activate the new config by adding it to the list of its https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/da7d4a1c38c0e0bd57806a486f3f42feb0492768/user/config/box.dhall#L18[`repos`] in `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall`.

### Install local packages

To install a package, just do:

```
→ nix-env -i geany <1>
```
<1> install the `geany` package for the vagrant user. The suffix _env_ expresses the fact that only the user environment is affected.

This imperative approach is quite useful for testing but the change is not persistent. When you settle down on a list of packages, please add them to `home.nix` to gain persistence.

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org]

### Open a shell

You can open a shell with the `nix-shell` commmand. For instance to open a shell that have `JAVA_HOME` set:

```
→ nix-shell -p jdk11
```

### Generic dotfiles

The standard https://github.com/CIRB/dotfiles[CIRB dotfiles repositry] maintains a very general default configuration for the devbox. It is continuously evolving and improving. Please feel welcomed to propose any change via a pull request.

TIP: To get a pre-defined default configuration for *Eclipse*, choose `.eclipse/workspace` as your workspace location at first boot.

### Personal mr repositories

You can register any source repository by adding it to https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/4da9cf0a073e98dcdafab5100c156dc537adf57a/config/box-cirb.dhall#L45[mr.config] in `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall`. This is for personal configuration that you don't want to share. After saving the file, you update your box with #updateUser#.

TIP: You can use #mr.config# to extend the CIRB dotfiles configuration with your files. The top help section of https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/4da9cf0a073e98dcdafab5100c156dc537adf57a/config/box-cirb.dhall#L17[ROOT_DIR/config/box-cirb.dhall] points to such a workflow as an example.


### Storing the box configuration file

You might want to go one step further and store your `box.dhall` file on Github or the like. This is pretty easy thanks to the powerful https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/README.md[dhall configuration language]. Replace the content of `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall` with one simple line containing an url that points to the config file. Here is an example:

.ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreR/devbox-config/master/box.dhall
```

## Life cycle

The https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues[issues] and the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open[roadmap] are handled directly on Github.

The devbox will be maintained continuously.
Two version are expected to be released every year in April and October following the NixOS release cycle.

The versioning scheme follows the one of NixOS. For instance `19.03.buildnumber`.

When a new version is released, it is expected to entail some incompatible changes together with a new version of the OS.
As a result, the box need to be destroy and re-create again. You should look at the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] to gather information and read the updated README to know more about breaking changes in configuration files.

TIP: Keep the old box and the new one for a while and make sure you haven't lost any customization.

Question, support, discussion are handled in the team `#cicd` channel.

## Without virtualbox

It is possible to use the devbox without the use of Virtualbox for instance within a Nixos linux or a vmware nixos guest.

If you have a nixbox linux up and running, follow these steps:
====
[lowerroman]
. mount your configuration into your nixos box, for instance `/vagrant/shared`
. `git clone https://github.com/CIRB/devbox.git bootstrap`
. `make update config_file=/vagrant/shared/config/box.dhall`
====

If you want to use vmware workstation, we can provide an up-to-dated  vmdk image. You still need to choose a ROOT_DIR to host your configuration files as explain in the <<_preparation, preparation paragraph>>.

## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and register them in stash.cirb.lanfootnote:[We will improve the situation in a future release if it is tagged as a major concern.].

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
That said, keep in mind that various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `hyper-v` and `virtualbox`. It is likely that such compatibilities arise again after a windows or virtualbox update.
+
We will try to offer a hyper-v compatible box using `packer` (no virtualbox) in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
In the meanwhile, if you face such a issue you will have to disable hyper-v to get a working devbox. Please proceed as follow:
+
[lowerroman]
. disable hyper-v
. use virtualbox as hypervisor
. install the docker tools based on a virtualbox machine.

NOTE: The only use of hyper-v we have detected so far is by the latest version of *Docker for Windows*.

For Mac users::
+
There are known critical issues with Virtualbox and VPN clients on `macosx`.

For VMWare users::
+
Please checkout https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1624437[this issue] about OpenSSH.

## FAQ

### Eclipse: how to add plugins ?

Eclipse plugins can easily be added. Please make a request to #devbox or https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues

## How is the box generated ?

The box (of about 2G) is generated in two stages.
The first step generates a minimal generic vagrant box file with packer (currently packer-1.3.5).
The second step applies some customization to produce a more heavy tailored box (desktop, ...).

### Stage 1

. On  a *linux* hostfootnote:[Cloning in Windows will cause many encoding issues!], use the provided `nixbox.sh` script to clone the https://github.com/nix-community/nixbox[nixbox repository] within the shared directory.
. On the host OS, in the nixbox directory, execute the following commands:
+
```
packer.exe build nixos-x86_64.json --only virtualbox-iso
```

### Stage 2

. Create a ROOT_DIR
. With `curl`, retrieve from this repository `config/box.dhall` & `config/shell.dhall`
. Import the `ova` image file using the Virtualbox UI.
. Start the imported vm, login as `vagrant`
.. cd into `/etc/devbox-x.x.x`
.. make system
.. make home-manager
.. logout/login as vagrant
.. make user
. Export the vm
. Push the output to a mirror site.


WARNING: Be careful of keeping the linux encoding when working on files that will end up in the  guest os.
