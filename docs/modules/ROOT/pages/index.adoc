## Overview

The devbox provides a virtualbox linux operating system that would typically run on top of a Windows host.
The box is based on https://nixos.org[NixOS] and make sure any setting can be persisted.

The main configuration file is `box.dhall`. It sits in your shared folder.

### Software requirements

- Virtualbox 6.0.x (tested with 6.0.12)

Please do update if you have older version(s).

## First time setup

[TIP]
====
- Have a quick look at the <<_troubleshooting>> section before to get started.
- You can install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for windows] in order to get a terminal console on Windows.
====

ifdef::backend-pdf[<<<]

### Preparation

====
Within the host os (usually `Windows`), create a folder #C:\Users\virtualbox\devbox-{latest_version}#.

Make sure your windows user has read/write permission on the folder.
On Windows, right-click on the folder and follow menu:Properties[Sharing].

This will be your shared folder between the host (Windows) and the guest (/vagrant in the linux box).
We will use the term `SHARED_DIR` to refer to this folder throughout the rest of the guide.
====

The `SHARED_DIR` contains personal configuration files.

   ├── local-home.nix  <2>
   └── [local-configuration.nix] <3>
-----
<1> ssh-keys folder
<2> user configuration
<3> optional system configuration

You don't need to create any of the user configuration files.
If the file is not yet present in the SHARED_DIR, it will be created by #updateConfig#.
You should then edit the file and fill the requested informationfootnote:[a comment section is present at the top.].

Type #updateConfig# again to activate those changes.

[WARNING]
====
- If you don't use the default host location for the SHARED_DIR, you will need to manually change the setting using the Virtualbox UI.
When doing so, please keep the name `vagrant` together with an empty mount point.
- When editing files from the SHARED_DIR, maintain the `unix` file encoding.
====

### ssh keys

Without your personal ssh key pairs you won't be able to pull or push to bitbucket repositories.

1. in the `SHARED_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.

### Box import

Get the latest `devbox-{latest_version}.x` file from https://repository.irisnet.be/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/cicd-devbox[Artifactory]

To import the `ova` image file, just click on the file. The virtualbox UI will pop up. You can accept all defaults.


## Usage

The provisioning of the devbox is done by 2 repositories (both on Bitbucket):

- http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/devbox/browse[devbox]
- http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse[dotfiles]

The `devbox` repository is quite small. It holds the ignition files necessary to bootstrap a devbox. This repository will be automatically present in the devbox in the `~/bootstrap` folder.

The `dotfiles` repository holds the user configuration files. The git repository is hidden from the user through the use of `vcsh`. The `vcsh` program is also helpful in case of crash to recover a clean user state.

### User provisioning

The most common operation is to modify your user configuration through `box.dhall` in your SHARED_DIR.

You might also want to modify your user configuration through the included https://github.com/rycee/home-manager[home-manager].
Such more advanced and optional configuration is done by editing the `local-home.nix` file which also sits in your SHARED_DIR.

To activate these changes, you execute the command #updateConfig# in a console.

### Devbox update

If you wish to update the files that provision the devbox, you do so by pulling them from the `dotfiles` and `devbox` source repositories.

The command #updateUser# defined in `~/.zsh_custom/fun.zsh` does this before activating the user configuration (#updateConfig# would only do the later).

You can also do these steps in a more fine grain way. For instance to pull the changes from `dotfiles`:

```
→ cd ~/bootstrap
→ git st <1>
→ git pull
```
<1> get the status

Similarly for the `dotfiles`:

```
→ vcsh dotfiles
→ git st
→ git pull --ff-only
→ exit <1>
```
<1> don't forget to exit the `vcsh` mode.

### Advanced system provisioning

The advanced user might want to update the system configuration.
This is useful to enable middleware such as a postgresql database, an elk cluster or a minishift.

If you want to go into this level of configuration, first import in your SHARED_DIR the example configuration file:
```
curl -o local-configuration.nix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/system/local-configuration.nix
```

To publish your system configuration change, you execute the command #updateSystem# in a console.

### Operating system (nixos)

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS] version {latest_version}. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager.

Compare to more traditional distributions, NixOS favors declarative settings and brings to the table the following properties:

- *reproducability*: everything is reproducible (packages are identical binary wise).
- *atomicity*: configuration changes can be rollback.
- *isolation*: on a project, user or system level, processes are built in an isolated environment.

By using `nixos` we are striving for a system that we can destroy and re-create at will without fuss.

The entry point for the system setup is the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file.

#### Useful command

```
# rebuild nixos after changing the system configuration file
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high)
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

```

### Windows manager (xmonad)

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

If you want another UI, based on Gnome, KDE, i3wm or Pantheon, that's easy enough.
Please ask for assistance on our #CICD Team channelfootnote:[If such request is popular, we will add an help section about it.]

#### Minimal cheat sheet

|======
|Command |Description

| kbd:[Ctrl,Space]footnote:[you can change this binding in box.dhall] |Open app launcher
| kbd:[Super, t] |New terminal
| kbd:[Super, 1..9] |Go to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super, Right] | Go to next desktop
| kbd:[Super, Left] | Go to previous desktop
| kbd:[Super, Shift, 1..9] |Switch to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super,Space] |Change between horizontal, vertical and stack layout
| kbd:[Super,Tab] |In stack layout, switch the stacked window
| kbd:[Super,q] |Close current window
| kbd:[Super,m] , kbd:[Super, h] |Resize windows
| kbd:[Super,w] |Put window back into tiling
| kbd:[F 1] |Open this README in a browser
|======

#### Layout

The active layout is displayed on the status bar:

image::layout-indicator.png[]

[width="35%"]
|=======
|Symbol |Name

| ≡     | horizontal
| ⊤     | horizontal tiled
| ∥     | vertical
| □     | full (stack)
| ⊢     | vertical tiled
|=======

TIP: You can also change layout by clicking on the symbol in the status bar.

### Terminal emulator (termite)

The `devbox` uses the https://github.com/thestinger/termite#keybindings[`termite`] terminal.

|=====
|Command | Description

|kbd:[Control,Shift, c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|kbd:[Control,Shift, {plus}/-/=] |Increase/Decrease/Reset font size
|kbd:[Control,Tab] |Start scrollback completion
|kbd:[Control,Shift,Space] |Start selection mode
|=====

The default user shell is `zsh` which allows for predictable history and completion.

You can use https://github.com/wting/autojump[`autojump`] to quickly navigate from one directory to another using the #j# shortcut:
```
# Go to your directory (you can omit the `cd`)
→ cd projects/cicd/puppet/bos
# Teach autojump that you like bos
→ autojump -i 20
# Open a new terminal. You can now quickly go to ~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos
→ j bos
```

If you wish to add some plugins to `oh-my-zsh` the setting is http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse/.config/nixpkgs/modules/profiles/zsh.nix#36[here]footnote:[let us know if such customization is of any interest and we will add a key in dhall.box for it.].

Another useful shortcut is #sshi# to quickly log to a remote machine. It is the equivalent of `ssh -i ~/.ssh/xxxx_rsa $LOGINID@$1`.

### Application launcher (albert)

https://albertlauncher.github.io/[Albert] is an application launcher similar to `Alfred` in OS X. You can launch albert with kbd:[Control,Space]footnote:[you can change the hotkey in the box.dhall configuration file.]. Use it to:

- open any application, directory or file by typing its name (type 'File' to open `Nautilus`)
- shutdown/reboot the vm
- search the internet with `gg`

### Projects (mr)

The https://myrepos.branchable.com[myrepos] project help you to automate the cloning of multiple git repositories. The usage of `mr` is optional but quite useful when you work on dozens of repositories.

Mr files are pointers to repositories you want to clone. These are defined in the same http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse/.config/mr/available.d[CIRB dotfiles repository]. You may propose any new repository definition via a pull request.

To activate an available repository in your devbox, add the name of the file to the `mr.repos` list in 'SHARED_DIR/box.dhall'.

As soon as you type #updateConfig# on the command line, the enabled repos will be automatically cloned and configured into your box. For instance if `puppet-bos` is in the list, you will find a `~/projects/bric/box/puppet-bos` folder. In that case, the next step would be to go in that folder and enter #make# on the command line.

To update all registered mr repository, do
```
→ mr -f up <1>
```
<1> you usually don't want to automatically update such repository on provisioning. That's the reason behind the `-f` (force) flag.

You can ask a `git status` of all your repositories with

```
→ mr st
```


### Local environment (direnv & lorri)

https://github.com/target/lorri[Lorri] removes the need to `nix-shell` into a project folder.
It prevents the project derivation to be garbage collected as the dependency graph is rebuild whenever the project dependencies changes.

## Tips & Tricks

====
The customization of the devbox operates at different levels and ensure configuration - personal or shared - survives the destruction of the box.
====

### Install local packages

To install a package, just do:

```
→ nix-env -i geany <1>
```
<1> install the `geany` package for the vagrant user. The suffix _env_ expresses the fact that only the user environment is affected.

This imperative approach is useful for testing but the change is not persistent. When you settle down on a list of packages, please add them to `local-home.nix` to gain persistence.

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org]

### Open a shell

You can open a shell with the `nix-shell` commmand. For instance to open a shell that have `JAVA_HOME` set:

```
→ nix-shell -p jdk11
```

### Generic dotfiles

The standard http://stash.cirb.lan/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse[CIRB dotfiles repositry] maintains a very general default configuration for the devbox. It is continuously evolving and improving. Please feel welcomed to propose any change via a pull request.


### Personal mr repositories

You can register any source repository by adding it to https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/4da9cf0a073e98dcdafab5100c156dc537adf57a/config/box-cirb.dhall#L45[mr.config] in `SHARED_DIR/box.dhall`. This is for personal configuration that you don't want to share. After saving the file, you update your box with #updateUser#.

### Storing the box configuration file

You might want to go one step further and store your `box.dhall` file on Github or the like. This is pretty easy thanks to the powerful https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/README.md[dhall configuration language]. Replace the content of `SHARED_DIR/box.dhall` with one simple line containing an url that points to the config file. Here is an example:

.SHARED_DIR/box.dhall
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreR/devbox-config/master/box.dhall
```

## Life cycle

The devbox will be maintained continuously.
Two version are expected to be released every year in April and October following the NixOS release cycle.

The versioning scheme follows the one of NixOS. For instance `19.09.buildnumber`.

When a new major version is released, breaking changes are expected.
It is required to destroy and re-create a box from scratch. An operation that take no longer than a few minutes.
Please look at the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] to gather information and read the updated README if necessary.
You would commonly need to make some adjustements to your personal configuration file such as `dhall.box` or `local-configuration.nix` before importing them in the new SHARED_DIR.

TIP: Keep the old box and the new one for a while and make sure you aren't losing any customization.

Question, support, discussion are handled in the team `#cicd` channel.

## Without virtualbox

It is possible to use the devbox without the use of Virtualbox for instance within a Nixos linux or a vmware nixos guest.

If you have a nixbox linux up and running, follow these steps:
====
[lowerroman]
. mount your configuration into your nixos box, for instance `/vagrant/shared`footnote:notrequired[not required if you don't want to configure anything]
. add an env variable named `SHARED_DIR` that points to the mounted dirfootnote:notrequired[]
. `git clone ssh://git@stash.cirb.lan:7999/devb/devbox.git bootstrap`
. cd bootstrap
. `make home-manager`
. (logout/login)
. `make user`
====

If you want to use vmware workstation, we can provide an up-to-dated  vmdk image. You still need to choose a SHARED_DIR to host your configuration files as explain in the <<_preparation, preparation paragraph>>.

## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and register them in stash.cirb.lanfootnote:[We will improve the situation in a future release if it is tagged as a major concern.].

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
That said, keep in mind that various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `hyper-v` and `virtualbox`. It is likely that such compatibilities arise again after a windows or virtualbox update.
+
We will try to offer a hyper-v compatible box using `packer` (no virtualbox) in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
In the meanwhile, if you face such a issue you will have to disable hyper-v to get a working devbox. Please proceed as follow:
+
[lowerroman]
. disable hyper-v
. use virtualbox as hypervisor
. Use the devbox for your docker need (docker is included out of the box) or install some docker tools based on virtualbox

NOTE: The only use of hyper-v we have detected so far is by the latest version of *Docker for Windows*.

For Mac users::
+
There are known critical issues with Virtualbox and VPN clients on `macosx`.

For VMware users::
+
There is currently an issue with packer & VMware Workstation.
If you want to use VMware, please ask for assistance.

## FAQ

### Eclipse: how to add plugins ?

Eclipse plugins can easily be added. Please make a request to the #CICD Team channel.

## How is the box generated ?

The box (of about 4G) is generated in two stages.
The first step generates a minimal generic vagrant box file with packer (currently packer-1.4.4).
The second step applies some customization to produce a more heavy tailored box (desktop, ...).

### Stage 1

. On  a *linux* hostfootnote:[Cloning in Windows will cause many encoding issues!], use the provided `nixbox.sh` script to clone the https://github.com/nix-community/nixbox[nixbox repository] within the shared directory.
. On the host OS, in the nixbox directory, execute the following commands:
+
```
packer.exe build nixos-x86_64.json --only virtualbox-iso
```

### Stage 2

. Create the SHARED_DIR
. Import the `ova` image file using the Virtualbox UI.
. Start the imported vm, login as `vagrant`
.. cd into `/etc/devbox-{latest_version}.x`
.. make system
.. make home-manager
.. reboot
.. cd into `/etc/devbox-{latest_version}.x`
.. make user
. Export the vm
. Push the ova to a mirror site.
