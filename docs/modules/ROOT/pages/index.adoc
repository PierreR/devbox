## Overview

image::devbox.png[]

### Software requirements

- Virtualbox 5.2.x (tested with 5.2.14)
- Vagrant 2.x (tested with 2.1.2)

Please do update if you have older version(s).

## First time setup

[TIP]
====
- Have a quick look at the <<_troubleshooting>> section before to get started.
- You can install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for windows] in order to get a terminal console on Windows.
====

### Preparation

1. Within the host os (usually `Windows`), create a new folder of your choice. You might call it `devbox-x.x` where `x.x` is the major and minor version number of the devbox.
+
====
We will use the term `ROOT_DIR` to refer to this folder throughout the rest of the guide.
====

2. In `ROOT_DIR`, create a new config folder and copy the two files from the  https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/config[config folder]. Modify them to match your personal settings:
+
```
mkdir config
curl -o config/box.dhall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/user/config/box.dhall
curl -o config/shell.dhall https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/user/config/shell.dhall
```
+
WARNING: If you create the file manually, make sure you keep a `unix` file encoding.

### ssh keys

1. in the `ROOT_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.

### Box import

Open a terminal in the `ROOT_DIR`. You might want to use 'Git bash here' if you have a git client on your Windows host.

To download the base box from our CIRB repository:
[subs=attributes+]
```
vagrant box add devbox-{latest_version} http://repo.irisnet.be/boxes/devbox.box
```

To initialize the box, in `ROOT_DIR` do:
[subs=attributes+]
```
vagrant init --minimal devbox-{latest_version} && vagrant up
```

[NOTE]
====
- Do not interrupt the process. The first time it takes a while to update and fetch all the required components. Check for io and network activity by looking at the icons at the bottom right corner of the virtualbox ui.
- In case any issue arises, please use the `#devbox` slack channel and ask for help.
====

When `vagrant up` terminates, restart your box in order to finalize your first time setup using:
```
vagrant reload
```

## Usage

WARNING: If you want to start the `devbox` from the Virtualbox UI, you should first uncomment https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/058fd956c62e890a775b3c8ce709a855e7b0c758/system/local-configuration.nix#L20-L24[these lines] from local-configuration.nix. Otherwise the shared folder (/vagrant) won't be mounted. On the other hand the command line (`vagrant up`) will always mount the shared folder.

### Vagrant

[subs=attributes+]
```
# boot the vm
vagrant up
# shutdown the vm
vagrant halt
# update system and user configuration
vagrant provision
# update user configuration only
vagrant provision --provision-with user
# update system configuration only
vagrant provision --provision-with system
# destroy the box (all local state is lost but the imported box remains)
vagrant destroy
# remove the imported box (necessary in case of a major version bump)
vagrant box remove devbox-{latest_version}

```

#### Provisioning

The provisioning is done automatically the first time `vagrant up` is executed. It is safe to provision on a regular basis using the `vagrant provision` command on the host. This will bring the new features listed in the <<_changelog>>. In case of a major version bump  a new devbox needs to be downloaded as described in <<_life_cycle>>.

Provisioning is separated into two steps:

- `vagrant provision --provision-with system`:
+
Update and (re)configure the system synchronizing the 'ROOT_DIR/local-configuration.nix'.
+
Updating the system takes a while and even more so if it is not done regularly.

- `vagrant provision --provision-with user`:
+
(Re)configuring the user is usually a quick task.
Given the personal settings defined in https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/user/config/box[user/config/box], it will:
+
* setup your git config
* synchronize the `ROOT_DIR/ssh-keys` folder
* update all declared `mr` repositories including the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox-dotfiles[dotfiles repo]
* install/update the cicd shell
* install all required packages for working with the puppet stacks

### Operating system (nixos)

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS] version 17.03. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the https://nixos.org/nix/[nix] package manager.

Compare to more traditional distributions, NixOS favors declarative settings and brings to the table the following properties:

- *reproducability*: everything is reproducible (packages are identical binary wise).
- *atomicity*: configuration changes can be rollback.
- *isolation*: on a project, user or system level, processes are built in an isolated environment.

By using `nixos` we are striving for a system that we can destroy and re-create at will without fuss.

The whole system setup is declared in the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/configuration.nix[/etc/nixos/configuration.nix] file. In the same file you will find the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/configuration.nix#L99-L209[list] of all the system packages installed.

#### Useful command

```
# rebuild nixos after changing the system configuration file
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# install a package in user space
→ nix-env -i atom

# clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high)
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d

```

### Windows manager (xmonad)

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

#### Minimal cheat sheet

|======
|Command |Description

| kbd:[Ctrl,Space] |Open app launcher
| kbd:[Super, t] |New terminal
| kbd:[Super, 1..9] |Go to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super, Right] | Go to next desktop
| kbd:[Super, Left] | Go to previous desktop
| kbd:[Super, Shift, 1..9] |Switch to nth desktop
| kbd:[Super,Space] |Change between horizontal, vertical and stack layout
| kbd:[Super,Tab] |In stack layout, switch the stacked window
| kbd:[Super,q] |Close current window
| kbd:[Super,m] , kbd:[Super, h] |Resize windows
| kbd:[Super,w] |Put window back into tiling
| kbd:[F 1] |Open this README in a browser
|======

#### Layout

The active layout is displayed on the status bar:

image::layout-indicator.png[]

[width="35%"]
|=======
|Symbol |Name
| ≡     | horizontal
| ⊤     | horizontal tiled
| ∥     | vertical
| □     | full (stack)
| ⊢     | vertical tiled
|=======

TIP: You can also change layout by clicking on the symbol in the status bar.

### Terminal emulator (termite)

The `devbox` uses the https://github.com/thestinger/termite#keybindings[`termite`] terminal.

|=====
|Command | Description

|kbd:[Control,Shift, c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|kbd:[Control,Shift, {plus}/-/=] |Increase/Decrease/Reset font size
|kbd:[Control,Tab] |Start scrollback completion
|kbd:[Control,Shift,Space] |Start selection mode
|=====

The default shell is `zsh` which allows for predictable history and completion.
You can revert to using `bash` as your default shell if you wish by removing all zsh related lines in the `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` file.

You can use https://github.com/wting/autojump[`autojump`] to quickly navigate from one directory to another using the #j# shortcut:
```
# Go to your directory (you can omit the `cd`)
→ cd projects/cicd/puppet/bos
# Teach autojump that you like bos
→ autojump -i 20
# Open a new terminal. You can now quickly go to ~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos
→ j bos
```

You might also want to enable some `oh-my-zsh` plugins by updating your zshrc. None has been enabled by default to avoid unwanted intrusion. See https://github.com/PierreR/dotfiles/blob/a8e45029767a22998f7a68fdf114297255495d0e/.zshrc#L3[here] for one example.

Another useful shortcut is #sshi# to quickly log to a remote machine. It is the equivalent of `ssh -i ~/.ssh/cirb_rsa $LOGINID@$1`.

### Application launcher (albert)

https://albertlauncher.github.io/[Albert] is an application launcher similar to `Alfred` in OS X. You can launch albert with kbd:[Control,Space]. Use it to:

- open any application, directory or file by typing its name (type 'File' to open `Nautilus`)
- shutdown/reboot the vm
- search the internet with `gg`

### Projects (mr)

The mr files are pointers to repositories you want to clone. These are defined in a separate github repo called  https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template/tree/master/.config/mr/available.d[vcsh_mr_template] .

You can activate any available repositories by setting `repos` in 'ROOT_DIR/config/box'.

The enabled repos will be automatically cloned and configured into your box. For instance if `puppet-bos` is in the list of `repos`, you will find a `~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos` folder. In that case, the next step would be to go in that folder and enter `make` on the command line.

To update all registered mr repository, do
```
→ mr -f up <1>
```
<1> you usually don't want to automatically update such repository on provisioning. That's the reason behind the `-f` (force) flag.

You can ask a `git status` of all your repositories with

```
→ mr st
```

### Cicd

After enabling the `puppetdb-dns` service in your `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` file, you can use a semantic name as a `dns` to lookup any machine known by `puppetdb`. The pattern to use is: #$subgroup.$role.$hostgroup.zone.cicd#.

For instance if you want to connect through ssh to the `bos` jenkins slave, you can (inside the devbox) use:

```
→  sshi jenkins.slave.bos.prod.cicd
```

In general you don't need to connect to nodes to manage, query or orchestrate them. Have a look at the <<_cicd_shell>> section to learn how to use the `cicd` command line utility.

For puppet help, go to the <<_puppet>> dedicated section.

## Customization

====
The customization of the devbox operates at different levels and makes sure every configuration - personal or shared - survives a `vagrant destroy`.
====

### System

You can add some specific configuration by editing `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix`.
For instance if you want to install the `geany` package, just uncomment the adhoc line in `local-configuration.nix`.

After changing the `local-configuration.nix` file, rebuild `nixos` with `nixos-rebuild switch` as root.

To avoid losing your customization after a `vagrant destroy`, copy `/etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix` into the ROOT_DIR folder. When such a file exists, it is used at the first boot and is synchronized at each provisioning.

TIP: If you wish to change the desktop or window manager you should change the `/etc/nixos/desktop-configuration.nix` file. Alike `local-configuratin.nix`, you then copy the file to ROOT_DIR to retain such config across `vagrant destroy`.

#### Alternative desktop manager

Instead of the minimal xmonad tiling windows manager, you might prefer using a complete desktop manager such as gnome or kde.
You can easily switch to kde or gnome by choosing to uncomment another line from your local configuration:

./etc/nixos/local-configuration.nix
[subs=+quotes]
```nix
  imports = [
    ./desktop-tiling-configuration.nix
    # ./desktop-gnome-configuration.nix
    # ./desktop-kde-configuration.nix
  ];
```

After the change, rebuild nixos using `nixreb` (an alias for `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`) and reboot the devbox.


### User

#### Install local packages

To install a package, just do:

```
→ nix-env -i geany <1>
```
<1> install the `geany` package for the vagrant user. The suffix _env_ expresses the fact that only the user environment is affected.

This imperative approach is quite useful for testing but the change is not recorded and won't survive a `vagrant destroy`. When you settle down on a list of packages, please add them to `local-configuration.nix` to gain persistence.

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org]

#### Available mr repositories

The devbox allows to quickly share any configuration across users. This is done by first adding a new `mr` source repository to the list of available repos https://github.com/CIRB/vcsh_mr_template/tree/master/.config/mr/available.d[in the mr CIRB template repository].

For instance, let say you want to propose some eclipse (or geany, atom, ...) setup as a base eclipse configuration for the CIRB. First create a git repository with the configuration files, then write a `.mr` file and propose it via  a pull request to the mr CIRB template repository.

As soon as the PR is merged, any devbox user will be able to activate the new config by adding it to the list of its https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/da7d4a1c38c0e0bd57806a486f3f42feb0492768/user/config/box.dhall#L18[`repos`] in `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall`.

#### Generic dotfiles

The standard https://github.com/CIRB/devbox-dotfiles[CIRB dotfiles repositry] maintains a very general default configuration for the devbox. It is continuously evolving and improving. Please feel welcomed to propose any change via a pull request.

TIP: To get a pre-defined default configuration for *Eclipse*, choose `.eclipse/workspace` as your workspace location at first boot.

#### Personal mr repositories

You can register any source repository by adding it to https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/da7d4a1c38c0e0bd57806a486f3f42feb0492768/user/config/box.dhall#L25[`additionalRepos`] in `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall`. This is for personal configuration that you don't want to share. After saving the file, you update your box with `vagrant provision`.

TIP: You can use `additionalRepos` to extend the CIRB dotfiles configuration with your files. The top help section of https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/da7d4a1c38c0e0bd57806a486f3f42feb0492768/user/config/box.dhall#L9-L12[ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall] points to such a workflow as an example.

WARNING: `additionalRepos` is meant as a static setting. It is only taken into account the first time you create a box. This is unlike `repos` for which the list of activated repositories is refreshed each time you provision.


#### Storing the box configuration file

You might want to go one step further and store your `box.dhall` file on Github or the like. This is pretty easy thanks to the powerful https://github.com/dhall-lang/dhall-lang/blob/master/README.md[dhall configuration language]. Replace the content of `ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall` with one simple line containing an url that points to the config file. Here is an example:

.ROOT_DIR/config/box.dhall
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreR/devbox-config/master/box.dhall
```

## Life cycle

The https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues[issues] and the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/milestones?direction=asc&sort=due_date&state=open[roadmap] are handled directly on Github. Alternatively you might want to use http://jira.cirb.lan/browse/CICDPROJ-150[Jira].

The devbox will be maintained continuously with at least a major release every six months to follow the OS life cycle.

The versioning scheme used is semantic: `major.minor.patch`.

A major jump is expected two or three times a year and entails incompatible changes. As a result, the box will need to be destroy and re-create again. You should look at the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] to gather information and read the updated README to know the details.

Here are the steps to migrate:

====
[lowerroman]
. destroy the old box losing all current statefootnote:[The README describes several tricks to keep/store your customization.] : `vagrant destroy`
. remove the old box: `vagrant box remove devbox-{latest_version}`
. add the new one: `vagrant box add devbox-{latest_version} http://repo.irisnet.be/boxes/devbox.box`
. initialize the new box: `vagrant init devbox-{latest_version} && vagrant up`
====

TIP: You might prefer to keep the old devbox around and create a new one to be 100% sure not to lose anything.

Question, support, discussion are handled in the slack `#devbox` channel.

## FAQ

### Vagrant: using Virtualbox UI

If you want to use the Virtualbox UI instead of the vagrant commands, you will need to uncomment the https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/blob/master/system/local-configuration.nix#L24-L28[following lines] in your ROOT_DIR/local-configuration.nix file.

### Eclipse: how to add plugins ?

Eclipse plugins can easily be added. Please make a request to #devbox or https://github.com/CIRB/devbox/issues


## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and register them in stash.cirb.lanfootnote:[We will improve the situation in a future release if it is tagged as a major concern.].

Virtualbox 5.0.x::
+
For some host OS, Vagrant does not start its network interface. You will need to manually go to menu:Machine[Configuration > Network] and ensure the box "Cable Connected" is checked.
This issue has also been encountered with virtualbox 5.1.2

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
That said, keep in mind that various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `hyper-v` and `virtualbox`. It is likely that such compatibilities arise again after a windows or virtualbox update.
+
We will try to offer a hyper-v compatible box using `packer` (no virtualbox) in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
In the meanwhile, if you face such a issue you will have to disable hyper-v to get a working devbox. Please proceed as follow:
+
[lowerroman]
. disable hyper-v
. use virtualbox as hypervisor
. install the docker tools based on a virtualbox machine.

NOTE: The only use of hyper-v we have detected so far is by the latest version of *Docker for Windows*.

For Mac users::
+
There are known critical issues with Virtualbox and VPN clients on `macosx`.


## How is the box generated ?

The box is generated using packer and the source files from https://github.com/zimbatm/nixbox[here]:

```
packer.exe build nixos-x86_64.json <1>
vagrant box add devbox-x.x-pre packer_virtualbox-iso_virtualbox.box
```
<1> be careful of keeping the linux file encoding while working on windows !

The size of the 'pre box' is ~ 300M

The box is then repackaged to a full vm:

```
git clone git@github.com:CIRB/devbox.git
cd devbox
vagrant up --no-provision
vagrant provision --provision-with system
vagrant reload
rm -rf /tmp/system # on the future packaged box
vagrant package --output devbox-x.x.x --vagrantfile Vagrantfile
```

The size of the repackaged vagrant box is ~ 2G.
