## Overview

The devbox provides a virtualbox linux operating system that would typically run on top of a Windows host.
The box is based on https://nixos.org[NixOS,role=external] and make sure any settings can be persisted.

The main configuration file is `box.dhall`. It sits in your shared folder.

## First time setup

[TIP, caption=Before you start]
====
- Install Virtualbox 6.1.x (tested with 6.1.22)
- Have a quick look at the <<_troubleshooting>> section.
- You can install https://git-scm.com/download/win[Git for windows,role=external] in order to get a terminal console on Windows.
====

### Preparation

====
Within the host os (usually `Windows`), create a folder #C:\Users\virtualbox\devbox-{latest_version}#.

Make sure your windows user has read/write permission on the folder.
On Windows, right-click on the folder and follow menu:Properties[Security].

This will be your shared folder between the host (Windows) and the guest (_/vagrant_ in the linux box).
We will use the term `SHARED_DIR` to refer to this folder throughout the rest of the guide.
====

The `SHARED_DIR` contains personal configuration files.

   ├── local-home.nix  <2>
   └── [local-configuration.nix] <3>
-----
<1> ssh-keys folder
<2> user configuration
<3> optional system configuration

You don't need to create any of the user configuration files.
If the file is not yet present in the SHARED_DIR, it will be created by #updateConfig#.
You should then edit the file and fill the requested informationfootnote:[a comment section is present at the top.].

Type #updateConfig# again to activate those changes.

[WARNING]
====
- If you don't use the default host location for the SHARED_DIR, you will need to manually change the setting using the Virtualbox UI.
When doing so, please keep the name `vagrant` together with an empty mount point.
- When editing files from the SHARED_DIR, maintain the `unix` file encoding.
====

### ssh keys

Without your personal ssh key pairs you won't be able to pull or push to bitbucket repositories.

1. in the `SHARED_DIR`, create a directory `ssh-keys`.
2. in this ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Bitbucket` key pair, rename them 'cirb_rsa' and 'cirb_rsa.pub' respectively if the filename differs.
3. in the ssh-keys subfolder, copy your `Github` key pair, rename them 'cirb_github_rsa' and 'cirb_github_rsa.pub'. If you use the same key pair, copy the previous pair and rename accordingly.

### Box import

Get the latest `devbox-{latest_version}.x` file from https://repository.irisnet.be/artifactory/webapp/#/artifacts/browse/tree/General/cicd-devbox[Artifactory]

To import the `ova` image file, just click on the file. The virtualbox UI will pop up. You can accept all defaults.


## Usage

### User provisioning

The most common operation is to modify your user configuration through `box.dhall` in your SHARED_DIR.

You might also want to modify your user configuration through the included https://github.com/rycee/home-manager[home-manager,role=external].
Such more advanced and optional configuration is done by editing the `local-home.nix` file which also sits in your SHARED_DIR.

To activate these changes, you execute the command #updateConfig# in a consolefootnote:[if you want to skip the mr step, you can use `home-manager switch`].

****
If you wish to update the files that provision the devbox, you do so with the #updateUser# command.
****

### System provisioning

The advanced user might want to update the system configuration.
This might useful to enable middleware such as a postgresql database, elk cluster, ...

If you want to go into this level of configuration, first import in your SHARED_DIR the example configuration file:
```
curl -o local-configuration.nix https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CIRB/devbox/master/system/local-configuration.nix
```

To publish your system configuration change, you execute the command #updateSystem# in a console.

### Operating system (nixos)

The devbox is based on https://nixos.org/[NixOS,role=external] version {latest_version}. NixOS is a Linux distribution based on the `nix` package manager.

Compare to more traditional distributions, NixOS favors declarative settings and brings to the table the following properties:

- *reproducibility*: everything is reproducible (packages are identical binary wise).
- *atomicity*: configuration changes can be rollback.
- *isolation*: on a project, user or system level, processes are built in an isolated environment.

By using `nixos` we are striving for a system that we can destroy and re-create at will without fuss.

The entry point for the system setup is the `/etc/nixos/configuration.nix` file.

.Useful command
----
# rebuild nixos after changing the system configuration file
→ sudo nixos-rebuild switch

# clean-up the store (whenever the disk usage is too high)
→ sudo nix-collect-garbage -d
----

### Windows manager (xmonad)

The devbox comes with a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager[tiling windows manager,role=external] called http://xmonad.org/[xmonad,role=external]. Such a minimal approach has been chosen for 3 reasons:

* Efficiency: the box needs to consume as minimum CPU/Mem resources as possible
* Simplicity: the window manager is basic but yet quite flexible
* Practicality: the desktop is distraction free.

If you want another UI, based on Gnome, KDE, i3wm or Pantheon, that's easy enough.
Please ask for assistance on our #CICD Team channelfootnote:[if such request is popular, we will add an help section about it.]

.Minimal cheat sheet

| ⊤     | horizontal tiled
| ∥     | vertical
| □     | full (stack)
| ⊢     | vertical tiled
|=======

TIP: You can also change layout by clicking on the symbol in the status bar.

### Terminal emulator (Alacritty)

The `devbox` uses the https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty[Alacritty, role=external] terminal by default.

|=====
|Command | Description

|kbd:[Control,Shift, c/v] | Copy/paste to/from clipboard
|kbd:[Control,Shift, {plus}/-/=] |Increase/Decrease/Reset font size
|kbd:[Control,Tab] |Start scrollback completion
|kbd:[Control,Shift,Space] |Start selection mode
|=====

The default user shell is `zsh` but you can easily switch to `bash` by changing https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/CICD/repos/devbox/browse/bootstrap/system/local-configuration.nix#8[this line]. Both allows for predictable history and completion.

You can use https://github.com/wting/autojump[autojump,role=external] to quickly navigate from one directory to another using the #j# shortcut:
----
# Go to your directory (you can omit the `cd`)
→ cd projects/cicd/puppet/bos
# Teach autojump that you like bos
→ autojump -i 20
# Open a new terminal. You can now quickly go to ~/projects/cicd/puppet/bos
→ j bos
----

If you wish to add some plugins to `oh-my-zsh` the setting is https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/CICD/repos/devbox/browse/.config/nixpkgs/modules/profiles/zsh.nix#35[here]footnote:[let us know if such customization is of any interest and we will add a key in dhall.box for it.].

Another useful shortcut is #sshi# to quickly log to a remote machine. It is the equivalent of `ssh -i ~/.ssh/xxxx_rsa $LOGINID@$1`.

### Application launcher (albert)

https://albertlauncher.github.io/[Albert,role=external] is an application launcher similar to `Alfred` in OS X. You can launch albert with kbd:[Control,Space]footnote:[you can change the hotkey in the box.dhall configuration file.]. Use it to:

- open any application, directory or file by typing its name (type 'File' to open `Nautilus`)
- shutdown/reboot the vm
- search the internet with `gg`

### Projects (mr)

The https://myrepos.branchable.com[myrepos,role=external] project help you to automate the cloning of multiple git repositories. The usage of `mr` is optional but quite useful when you work with dozens of repositories.

Mr files are pointers to repositories you want to clone. These are defined in the same https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/CICD/repos/devbox/browse/.config/mr/available.d[CIRB dotfiles repository]. You may propose any new repository definition via a pull request.

To activate an available repository in your devbox, add the name of the file to the `mr.repos` list in `SHARED_DIR/box.dhall`.

As soon as you type #updateConfig# on the command line, the enabled repos will be automatically cloned and configured into your box. For instance if `puppet-bos` is in the list, you will find a `~/projects/bric/box/puppet-bos` folder. In that case, the next step would be to go in that folder and enter #make# on the command line.

[WARNING]
====
Some `mr` description files purposefully prevent the repository update by using the https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/DEVB/repos/dotfiles/browse/.config/mr/available.d/idm-back.mr#7[#skip#] marker.
For those repositories, `updateConfig` won't do anything.

In that case and more particularly when you first boot a new devbox, you might want to force the update.
In the home folder, use the following command:

.force mr repo updates
----
~ → mr -f up <1>
----
<1> `-f` is forcing the update
====

[NOTE]
====
You can ask for a `git status` of all your repositories with
----
~ → mr st
----
====

### Local environment (direnv)

https://direnv.net/[direnv,role=external] removes the need to `nix-shell` into a project folder.
It prevents the project derivation to be garbage collected as the dependency graph is rebuild whenever the project dependencies changes.

### Tips & tricks

====
The customization of the devbox operates on different levels and ensure configuration - personal or shared - survives the destruction of the box.
====

To install a package, the declarative and recommend practice is to add it to your _SHARED_DIR/local-home.nix_.
You then use #updateConfig# to activate the change.

Another approach is to use `nix-env` footnote:[suffix _env_ expresses the fact that only the user vagrant is affected]:

----
nix-env -i firefox
----

It is fast but the imperative command does not persist the configuration.
If the use case is to be able to quickly test something, it is recommended to open a `nix shell` instead:

```
nix-shell -p jdk11 <1>
```
<1> open a shell that have `JAVA_HOME` set to use jdk11.

You can quickly search for packages online at https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html[nixos.org,role=external]

.Storing the box configuration file
****
You might want to go one step further and store your _box.dhall_ file in Git.
This is easy. Replace the content of the file with one line containing an url that points to the config file.
Here is an example:

.SHARED_DIR/box.dhall
```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PierreR/devbox-config/master/box.dhall
```
****

## Using another unix distribution

The devbox provides an easy way to get started.
Nevertheless if you use Windows or prefer another linux derivation (such as Ubuntu for instance) it is possible to do so and still benefit from the https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/CICD/repos/nixpkgs-overlays/browse[binary cache] the CICD team provided.

### Windows (WSL)

. Enable WSL feature
. Open PowerShell with Admin right and execute the following script:

```
Set-Location -Path C:\Users\Public\Downloads
wsl --unregister NixOS
New-Item nixos -ItemType directory -Force
Set-Location -Path ./nixos
wget https://repository.irisnet.be/artifactory/cicd-nix-local/nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz -OutFile ./nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz
wsl --import NixOS .\nixos nixos-system-x86_64-linux.tar.gz --version 2
```

### Linux

. install nix on your linux machine following https://nixos.org/download.html[these instructions, role=external]. It is actually a single command:
+
```
curl -L https://nixos.org/nix/install | sh
```
You then activate `nix` in your terminal, by adding the following line in your `.bash_profile`:
+
```
source ~/.nix-profile/etc/profile.d/nix.sh
```
. export the #NIX_PATH# environment variable (in _.bashrc_, _.profile_ or a location that suits your distribution the best):
+
[subs=attributes+]
```
export NIX_PATH=$NIX_PATH:nixpkgs-overlays=https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/CICD/nixpkgs-overlays/archive/{latest_version}.tar.gz
```
. Add the current nixpkgs pointer
+
```
cat > ~/.nix-channels <<EOF
https://releases.nixos.org/nixos/21.11/nixos-21.11.334139.1bd4bbd49be/nixexprs.tar.xz nixpkgs
EOF
```
IMPORTANT: You will need to manually follow the update of https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/PUP/repos/puppet-profile/browse/manifests/nix.pp#27[the pointer].
. Update your nix channel
+
```
nix-channel --update
```
. configure the binary cache
+
```
cat > ~/.config/nix/nix.conf <<EOF
substituters = https://repository.irisnet.be/artifactory/nix/
trusted-public-keys = nix.cirb.org:CeHSF470ofjLTEwKr4nyGXlH8Haxelxu1RItfo7yOZU= cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY=
sandbox = false
EOF
```
. configure nix
+
```
cat > ~/.config/nixpkgs/config.nix <<EOF
{ allowUnfree = true; allowBroken = true; }
EOF
```
. install https://direnv.net/[direnv,role=external]
. The `devbox` automates some user configurations. One example is the connection to `git`.
You will need to realize these configuration yourself for your distribution.

## Life cycle

The devbox will be maintained continuously.
Two version are expected to be released every year in April and October following the NixOS release cycle.

The versioning scheme follows the one of NixOS. For instance `20.03.buildnumber`.

When a new major version is released, breaking changes are expected.
It is required to destroy and re-create a box from scratch. An operation that take no longer than a few minutes.
Please look at the xref:devbox/CHANGELOG.adoc[Changelog] to gather information and read the updated README if necessary.
You would commonly need to make some adjustments to your personal configuration file such as `dhall.box` or `local-configuration.nix`.

TIP: Keep the old box and the new one for a while and make sure you aren't losing any customization.

Question, support, discussion are handled in the team `#cicd` channel.

## Troubleshooting

Ssh-key with passphrase::
+
Using cirb ssh-keys with a passphrase will currently cause difficulties with `mr`, a tool we use to handle git repositories in a declarative way. It will prevent some of the automation to go through (nothing critical though). If possible, please regenerate a pair of keys with no passphrase and add them to the SCM.

For Windows 10 users::
+
Everything usually just works on Windows 10.
In the past, various issues have been reported concerning incompatibilities between `Hyper-V` and `Virtualbox`.
Latest versions of Virtualbox should be compatible though.
+
We might offer a WSL2/Hyper-V compatible box in the future. Packer has just announced such a support. Stay tune.
+
NOTE: It is possible to use *Docker for Windows* https://poweruser.blog/docker-on-windows-10-without-hyper-v-a529897ed1cc[without Hyper-V, role=external].

For Mac users::
+
There are known critical issues with Virtualbox and VPN clients on `macosx`.

For VMware users::
+
There is currently an issue with packer & VMware Workstation.
Since 6.1, Virtualbox supports nested hardware-virtualization on Intel CPUs (starting with 5th generation Core i, codename Broadwell).
Support for VMware Workstation is not provided.

## How is the box generated ?

The box (of about 4G) is generated using the configuration source files from the _bootstrap/nixbox_ folder.
The _nixbox_ folder is a stripped and customized clone of the https://github.com/nix-community/nixbox[nixbox project, role=external].
The first step uses https://www.packer.io[Packer, role=external] to create a minimal `ova`.
The second step applies the system & user customizations to produce a more heavy tailored box.

NOTE: If you want to generate the `ova` from your Windows host, copy the _nixbox_ folder in your `SHARED_DIR`.

[lowerroman]
. Go to the nixbox  https://bitbucket.irisnet.be/projects/CICD/repos/devbox/browse/bootstrap[folder].
. `packer build nixos-x86_64.json`
. Import the generated `ova` in Virtualbox
.. Change name (_devbox-{latest_version}_)
. Change machine configuration
.. Storage disk option : Storage > check `Solid state`)
.. Disable remote access : Display > remote Display > uncheck `Enable Server`
. Before running vm, ensure that folder `C:\Users\virtualbox\devbox-21.11` is created.
.. Files `box.dhall` and `local-home.nix` must be also present inside this folder.
. Start the vm and login with vagrant/vagrant
. Keyboard is still qwerty at this stage. If you want to change it type `sudo loadkeys be-latin1`
. Go to the _/etc/devbox-{latest_version}.x_ folder and run `make system`
. Reboot
. On login page, press : Ctrl + Alt + F1
. Login with vagrant/vagrant (keyboard must be in azerty)
. Go to the _/etc/devbox-{latest_version}.x_ folder and run `make user`
. Reboot

### Update NixOS

To update the devbox to a new version of NixOS you follow these steps:

. create a new branch (for instance `21.11`)
. update the `bootstrap/version.sh`
. update the `bootstrap/nixbox` with the correct pointers
. update _.config/nixpkgs/home.nix_ with the correct channels

## FAQ

### Eclipse: how to add plugins ?

If you enable `eclipse` in #$SHARED_DIR/box.dhall#, you might want to add the `egit` and `m2e` plugins.

.enable egit and m2e
```
→ cd ~/bootstrap
→ make eclipse-extraplugins
```

If you miss other plugins, let us know.
